Version 0.7.0 (released with SMRTanalysis 2.1)
  * Support for diploid variant calling in plurality and quiver algorithms
  * Auto-windowing to skip coverage deserts, drastically improving user experience
    for amplicon workflows.
  * Fix for memory leak when running assemblies with many contigs
  * Command line support for operating on a chosen barcode
  * Fix bug in dinucleotide repeat refinement
  * Modification to variants.gff schema to support diploid variant reporting
  * Improved support for P4-C2 chemistry
  * Fix for memory leak affecting jobs with many reference contigs
    (large assemblies, for example)

Version 0.6.0 (released with SMRTanalysis 2.0)
  * Improved Quiver accuracy, reducing errors in dinucleotide repeat regions
  * Improved, extensible support for existing and forthcoming sequencing chemistries
