# column.   Each variant will have a frequency and confidence value associated
# with it.  The locus summary should reflect that somehow.  There may also
# need to be some re-design work here to better reflect the data structure
# needs of the rare variant algorithm.

# We're only using CCS reads here for a first pass.  To support a new downstream
# feature, correlated mutations, we may want to output read ids associated
# with each particular variant.
