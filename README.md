GenomicConsensus provides one tool, variantCaller.py, which performs
variant and consensus calling for PacBio sequence data.  It is the
main driver program for the Quiver algorithm.

INSTALLING:

    Make sure you have set up and activated your virtualenv, and
    installed pbcore and ConsensusCore (which cannot be installed
    automatically by pip or setuptools).  Then:

    % python setup.py install
