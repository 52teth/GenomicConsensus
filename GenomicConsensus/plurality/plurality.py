        Our plurality confidence metric is a phred-transformed
        probability based on the assumption that each read is an
        independent observation of the true base, with error
        probability 0.15.

        For a true genomic sequence G, we have a vector of reads X =
        (X_1, X_2, ..., X_d) with values in S = {s_1, s_2, ..., s_k},
        and corresponding frequencies N = {n_1, n_2, ..., n_k}---where
        we have indexed the sets S and N in descending frequency
        order.

        If we allow that

           Pr(X | G \not\in S) = (0.15)^d;
           Pr(X | G = s_1)     = (0.85)^n_1 * (0.15)^(d-n_1);
           Pr(X | G = s_2)     = (0.85)^n_2 * (0.15)^(d-n_2); etc.

        and then impose an uninformative prior distribution on G, such
        that the events G = s_i \forall i, G \not\in S, are all
        equiprobable (which may or may not be reasonable---revisit
        this later), then the respective posterior probabilities for G
        can be found from the above formulas after normalizing by the
        sum.
